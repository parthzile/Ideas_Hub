The folder Ideas_Hub_B is a Django project. Home is the first app of the backend and, as of now, the only one. I refactored the html and css code so that the code for nav-bar is not repeatedly used in all the webpages repeatedly.

<h2>The issues that needs to be fixed:</h2>

1.CSRF authentication for “Add idea” and “Login” buttons.

2.Fixing the title of every webpage using Django block tags.

3.Fixing CSS for blank idea webpage.

<h2>Things to do:</h2>

Configuring the Login page in backend.

Adding a webpage to display the expanded idea to the user.

Fixing the postion of Add idea and Login Button.
